Hello there! I am egg ltd, and I am interested developping.
I am currently learning ethical hacking, and preparing for PNPT exam.

I really enjoy programming and a whole magic of silicon.
When I was first on some simple blocked programming languages
like scratch, I was very impressed because it was very exciting
to make my first game. Then the older I get, I got curious how were
the apps are made, and even how is scratch is made. Other students
wern't quite curious about it, but I did. So that was the beginning of my 
journey :D
